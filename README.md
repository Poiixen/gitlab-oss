# AI Corps x GitLab: Open Source Contribution Learning Path

AI Corps is CodePath’s advanced open-source engineering capstone program designed to help emerging engineers gain validated proof of their ability to contribute to production-grade software. Across ten weeks, students will be contributing directly on GitLab’s platform, learning to navigate real workflows (issue boards, merge requests, code reviews, CI/CD) while producing work that your maintainers can accept, refine, or provide feedback on.

**Dates:** February 20 – May 1, 2026

## The Four Phases

| Phase | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| 1. Issue Selection | Choose a workable GitLab issue and document why |
| 2. Solution Planning | Reproduce the issue locally, fork the repo, draft a solution plan |
| 3. Building & Testing | Implement your solution using AI-assisted workflows, write tests |
| 4. MR Submission & Review | Submit your merge request and respond to reviewer feedback |
